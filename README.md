Responsible Pet Adoption

This project is  a social media for users who are sharing information about  animals who has been lost , rescued, or found in somewhere.
It is a new social media , just to share post between users , about the animals , and the treatments done with them.

The project is made in Django (backend), with Html, Css (front-end) and we will use SQL as a database.

I will continue to explain this project as its getting progresses.
