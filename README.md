Responsible Pet Adoption

This project is being building  for a foundation that rescues animals who lives in the street , make veterinary medical treatments, 
looks for a resposable owner  and once it tracks that animal for a specified time. It is a non-profit foundation,
that's why  we also implemented a bank account to be able to offer the sending of donations that will be used for the medical treatment of animals.

The project is made in Django (backend), with Html, Css (front-end) and we will use SQL as a database.

We will generate Applications in the project: 1) Responsible Adoption 
                                              2) About Us 
                                              3) Contact

I will continue to explain this project as its getting progresses.
